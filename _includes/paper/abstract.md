Research Software Engineering is becoming increasingly more complex in
terms of technology and the need for communication between teams needing
to work in both high performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing
environments. This challenge would be well addressed by a movement to
identify categories of functional need in this space, and best practices
and tools used for each. In this paper we introduce "RSE-ops," or
Research Software Engineering Operations, a movement to mirror DevOps
{% cite Atlassian_undated-ka %}, best practices to bridge development and
operations in typically cloud communities, and provide structure for
better collaboration and navigation of the space.
