  <p>Collaboration is a central activity in software engineering, as
               all but the most trivial projects involve multiple engineers
               working together. Hence, understanding software engineering
               collaboration is important for both engineers and researchers.
               This chapter presents a framework for understanding software
               engineering collaboration, focused on three key insights: (1)
               software engineering collaboration is model-based, centered on
               the creation and negotiation of shared meaning within the
               project artifacts that contain the models that describe the
               final working system; (2) software project management is a
               cross-cutting concern that creates the organizational structures
               under which collaboration is fostered (or dampened); and (3)
               global software engineering introduces many forms of distance –
               spatial, temporal, socio-cultural – into existing pathways of
               collaboration. Analysis of future trends highlight several ways
               engineers will be able to improve project collaboration,
               specifically, software development environments will shift to
               being totally Web-based, thereby opening the potential for
               social network site integration, greater participation by
               end-users in project development, and greater ease in global
               software engineering. Just as collaboration is inherent in
               software engineering, so are the fundamental tensions inherent
               in fostering collaboration; the chapter ends with these.</p>
