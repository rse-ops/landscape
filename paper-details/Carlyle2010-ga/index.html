  <p>The increasing availability of commercial cloud computing
               resources in recent years has caught the attention of the
               high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific computing
               community. Many researchers have subsequently examined the
               relative computational performance of commercially available
               cloud computing offerings across a number of HPC application
               bench-marks and scientific workflows, but the analogous cost
               comparisons-i.e., comparisons between the cost of doing
               scientific computation in traditional HPC environments vs. cloud
               computing environments-are less frequently discussed and are
               difficult to make in meaning-ful ways. Such comparisons are of
               interest to traditional HPC resource providers as well as to
               members of the scientific research community who need access to
               HPC resources on a routine basis. This paper is a case study of
               costs incurred by faculty end-users of Purdue University’s HPC
               “community cluster” program. We develop and present a per
               node-hour cloud computing equivalent cost that is based upon
               actual usage patterns of the community cluster participants and
               is suitable for direct comparison to hourly costs charged by one
               commercial cloud computing provider. We find that the majority
               of community cluster participants incur substantially lower
               out-of-pocket costs in this community cluster program than in
               purchasing cloud computing HPC products.</p>
