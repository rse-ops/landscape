  <p>The Supercomputing Education and Research Centre (SERC) at the
               Indian Institute of Science (IISc), located in the South East
               Asian Region, has been providing state-of-the-art services and
               support for High Performance Computing (HPC) for the academic
               users of the institute since 1990. This centre, facilitates
               OpenMP, MPI, CUDA and OpenCL based HPC jobs for academic
               research. To augment or support the existing demand for compute
               intensive, tightly coupled HPC workloads in the institute, it
               was desirable to explore cloud based HPC services. This study is
               a comparative cost-benefit analysis of the in-house compute
               facility at SERC with that of the commercial cloud providers
               like Amazon, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Sabalcore. The
               Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of SahasraT (the in-house
               supercomputer) is computed and used to identify the cost of
               running a small job for 24 hours on the in-house facility. This
               is then compared with the estimated cost of running the same job
               on comparative cloud instances. Several research papers that
               provide a detailed evaluation of HPC on the cloud with
               performance benchmarks and the comparison to in-house HPC
               facilities, were studied. These references have been used to
               compare performance of compute instance in the public cloud to
               the performance of HPC at SahasraT. The results obtained in this
               study, advocate that current cloud platforms are expensive in
               both cost and performance as compared to the in-house facility
               at SERC.</p>
