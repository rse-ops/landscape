  <p>HPC centers are facing increasing demand for greater software
               flexibility to support faster and more diverse innovation in
               computational scientific work. Containers, which use Linux
               kernel features to allow a user to substitute their own software
               stack for that installed on the host, are an increasingly
               popular method to provide this flexibility. Because standard
               container technologies such as Docker are unsuitable for HPC,
               three HPC-specific technologies have emerged: Charliecloud,
               Shifter, and Singularity. A common concern is that containers
               may introduce performance overhead. To our knowledge, no
               comprehensive, rigorous, HPC-focused assessment of container
               performance has previously been performed. Our present
               experiment compares the performance of all three HPC container
               implementations and bare metal on multiple dimensions using
               industry-standard benchmarks (SysBench, STREAM, and HPCG). We
               found no meaningful performance differences between the four
               environments, with the possible exception of modest variation in
               memory usage. These results suggest that HPC users should feel
               free to containerize their applications without concern about
               performance degradation, regardless of the container technology
               used. It is an encouraging development towards greater adoption
               of user-defined software stacks to increase the flexibility of
               HPC systems.</p>
