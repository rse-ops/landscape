  <p>Cloud computing is too often seen as a tactical way to reduce
              costs, when its most important benefit is as a strategic way to
              grow revenues. Such revenue growth can come about in a variety of
              ways, such as through faster innovation of new products,
              processes, and customer interactions; identifying more customers
              and closing more purchases; and improving customer relationships
              through more targeted offers and better service and experiences.
              Companies that clearly understand the relative magnitude of cost
              savings and revenue growth and orient themselves toward the
              latter will better exploit the cloud and related technologies
              such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of
              Things, and blockchain, and thus strengthen their competitive
              advantage and customer value.</p>
