  <p>HPC centers face increasing demand for software flexibility,
                   and there is growing consensus that Linux containers are a
                   promising solution. However, existing container build
                   solutions require root privileges and cannot be used
                   directly on HPC resources. This limitation is compounded as
                   supercomputer diversity expands and HPC architectures become
                   more dissimilar from commodity computing resources. Our
                   analysis suggests this problem can best be solved with
                   low-privilege containers. We detail relevant Linux kernel
                   features, propose a new taxonomy of container privilege, and
                   compare two open-source implementations: mostly-unprivileged
                   rootless Podman and fully-unprivileged Charliecloud. We
                   demonstrate that low-privilege container build on HPC
                   resources works now and will continue to improve, giving
                   normal users a better workflow to securely and correctly
                   build containers. Minimizing privilege in this way can
                   improve HPC user and developer productivity as well as
                   reduce support workload for exascale applications.</p>
