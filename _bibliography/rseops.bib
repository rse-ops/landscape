               community. Many researchers have subsequently examined the
               relative computational performance of commercially available
               cloud computing offerings across a number of HPC application
               bench-marks and scientific workflows, but the analogous cost
               comparisons-i.e., comparisons between the cost of doing
               scientific computation in traditional HPC environments vs. cloud
               computing environments-are less frequently discussed and are
               difficult to make in meaning-ful ways. Such comparisons are of

               members of the scientific research community who need access to
               HPC resources on a routine basis. This paper is a case study of

               is suitable for direct comparison to hourly costs charged by one
               commercial cloud computing provider. We find that the majority
               of community cluster participants incur substantially lower

               flexibility to support faster and more diverse innovation in
               computational scientific work. Containers, which use Linux
               kernel features to allow a user to substitute their own software
               stack for that installed on the host, are an increasingly
               popular method to provide this flexibility. Because standard
               container technologies such as Docker are unsuitable for HPC,
               three HPC-specific technologies have emerged: Charliecloud,
               Shifter, and Singularity. A common concern is that containers
               may introduce performance overhead. To our knowledge, no
               comprehensive, rigorous, HPC-focused assessment of container
               performance has previously been performed. Our present
               experiment compares the performance of all three HPC container
               implementations and bare metal on multiple dimensions using
               industry-standard benchmarks (SysBench, STREAM, and HPCG). We
               found no meaningful performance differences between the four
               environments, with the possible exception of modest variation in
               memory usage. These results suggest that HPC users should feel
               free to containerize their applications without concern about
               performance degradation, regardless of the container technology
               used. It is an encouraging development towards greater adoption

               OpenMP, MPI, CUDA and OpenCL based HPC jobs for academic
               research. To augment or support the existing demand for compute
               intensive, tightly coupled HPC workloads in the institute, it
               was desirable to explore cloud based HPC services. This study is
               a comparative cost-benefit analysis of the in-house compute
               facility at SERC with that of the commercial cloud providers
               like Amazon, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Sabalcore. The
               Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of SahasraT (the in-house

               running a small job for 24 hours on the in-house facility. This
               is then compared with the estimated cost of running the same job
               on comparative cloud instances. Several research papers that
               provide a detailed evaluation of HPC on the cloud with
               performance benchmarks and the comparison to in-house HPC
               facilities, were studied. These references have been used to
               compare performance of compute instance in the public cloud to
               the performance of HPC at SahasraT. The results obtained in this
               study, advocate that current cloud platforms are expensive in

                   performance for scientific applications broadly? Despite

                   Answers are crucial for designing future systems and
                   democratizing high-performance computing. We present a
                   multi-level approach to investigate the performance gap
                   between HPC and cloud computing, isolating different
                   variables that contribute to this gap. Our experiments are
                   divided into (i) hardware and system microbenchmarks and
                   (ii) user application proxies. The results show that today's

  abstract      = "HPC centers face increasing demand for software flexibility,
                   and there is growing consensus that Linux containers are a
                   promising solution. However, existing container build
                   solutions require root privileges and cannot be used
                   directly on HPC resources. This limitation is compounded as
                   supercomputer diversity expands and HPC architectures become
                   more dissimilar from commodity computing resources. Our
                   analysis suggests this problem can best be solved with
                   low-privilege containers. We detail relevant Linux kernel
                   features, propose a new taxonomy of container privilege, and
                   compare two open-source implementations: mostly-unprivileged
                   rootless Podman and fully-unprivileged Charliecloud. We
                   demonstrate that low-privilege container build on HPC
                   resources works now and will continue to improve, giving
                   normal users a better workflow to securely and correctly
                   build containers. Minimizing privilege in this way can
                   improve HPC user and developer productivity as well as
                   reduce support workload for exascale applications.",

               working together. Hence, understanding software engineering
               collaboration is important for both engineers and researchers.
               This chapter presents a framework for understanding software
               engineering collaboration, focused on three key insights: (1)
               software engineering collaboration is model-based, centered on
               the creation and negotiation of shared meaning within the
               project artifacts that contain the models that describe the
               final working system; (2) software project management is a
               cross-cutting concern that creates the organizational structures
               under which collaboration is fostered (or dampened); and (3)
               global software engineering introduces many forms of distance --
               spatial, temporal, socio-cultural -- into existing pathways of
               collaboration. Analysis of future trends highlight several ways
               engineers will be able to improve project collaboration,
               specifically, software development environments will shift to
               being totally Web-based, thereby opening the potential for
               social network site integration, greater participation by
               end-users in project development, and greater ease in global
               software engineering. Just as collaboration is inherent in
               software engineering, so are the fundamental tensions inherent
               in fostering collaboration; the chapter ends with these.",
